# Reinfall Prediction

This project is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization using Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn.

## Project Structure
Reinfall_Predictionipynb.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow for rainfall prediction including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Problem Statement
To predict whether it will rain tomorrow using meteorological data. The prediction is a binary classification task: Yes (it will rain) or No (it will not).

## Dataset
The dataset used contains weather observations such as:

Temperature (Min, Max)

Rainfall

Wind speed/direction

Humidity

Pressure

Cloud cover

Rain Today (Yes/No)

Rain Tomorrow (Yes/No) â€” target variable

## Libraries Used
pandas: for data loading and manipulation

numpy: for numerical operations

matplotlib, seaborn: for data visualization

sklearn: for machine learning models and evaluation

LabelEncoder & StandardScaler: for encoding categorical values and scaling features

## Data Preprocessing
Loading Data: Read CSV using pandas.

Handling Missing Values: Dropped columns with many missing values and filled remaining nulls.

Label Encoding: Converted categorical variables (RainToday, RainTomorrow) into numerical labels.

Feature Scaling: Applied StandardScaler to normalize the data.

## Models Used
Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Each model was trained and tested using the same features and evaluated based on accuracy.

## Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

## Key Results
The notebook compares the performance of the models. Generally:

Random Forest performed the best among the three models.

Visualization of confusion matrices helped interpret true positives and false negatives.

## Visualizations
Correlation heatmap

Distribution of target variable

Confusion matrices for each model

## How to Run
Install required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook Reinfall_Predictionipynb.ipynb
Run the cells sequentially.

## Future Improvements
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Use cross-validation to better generalize model performance

Try more complex models like XGBoost or LightGBM

Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
